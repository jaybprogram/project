                What a great way to end the semester with a cool project! I had a lot of fun working on it. Initially, it was a bit challenging, but I was able to achieve the final product I had envisioned. The most difficult part was working with media queries and Flexbox, as creating a responsive layout for mobile devices can be tricky. I encountered a few bugs, such as images not displaying properly and font sizes not adjusting as the screen size decreased. Still, I solved those problems after looking at old material and online sources. My favorite part of the project was styling the cover screen. Once I got the structure in place, I was very happy with the final result.

This course has helped me tremendously in my learning of web development. I was able to learn the basics of HTML and understand how it serves as the building block of a website. Although it was challenging at times, I was able to enhance my skills in CSS and learn essential design principles to better style and organize a website.

I'm glad we got a sneak peek into JavaScript because it is a very important language to learn. I also enjoyed the projects, as they provided freedom and flexibility as long as the minimum tasks were completed. My favorite project was Lab 7, where we created a tier list.

Lastly, I appreciated our in-person lectures. I found them to be very in-depth and insightful. I especially liked how our professor created a comfortable environment where students felt encouraged to ask questions and seek help when they were stuck.
